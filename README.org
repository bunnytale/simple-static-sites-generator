* static sites tool

  this is a small tooling I`ve been using to create static sites and prototypes faster
  for some applications, I hope it could be helpful for someone

** scripts

   /npm build/: build pages from source once

   /npm watch/: will run gulp watch and recompile the pages whenever a change occur to
   its sources

** directory structure
   your less (styling) code must be placed inside /\/src\/styles\// directory and the final
   processed css files will created within /\/public\/css/ directory.

   pug templates must be in /\/src\/templates/ directory.

   your coffeescript files should stay in your /\/src\/scripts/ directory as well.

   static assets must live in \/assets\/ directories, they are not processed by any means
   from gulp tasks.
